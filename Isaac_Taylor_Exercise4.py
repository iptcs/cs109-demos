# Protected Division
#
# Math tells us that dividing any number by zero is
# impossible. When we try to do this in Python we get
# a ZeroDivisionError.
#
# Let's suppose that we need to define a new behavior
# for dividing by zero that does not throw an error. We
# can write a new function to do this.
#
# Let's call our function protected_dividion(n, d) and
# write it so that it takes 2 arguments.
#
# The first argument should be the numerator.
# The second argument should be the denominator.
#
# If the denominator is zero, the function should return zero.
# If the denominator is any number other than zero, it should return
# the numerator divided by the denominator.
# 

### START YOUR CODE ###
def protected_dividsion(x, y):
    if y != 0 and x != 0:
        result = x / y
        print(x / y)
    else:
        result = 0.0
        print(result)
    return result

# Word Count
# 
# This sentence has 5 words.
#
# Notice that the above sentence has 4 space characters. In fact,
# if we denote the number of space characters as s, we can say
# that every string has s + 1 words in it.
#
# We can write a function that will take a string as input, count
# the number of spaces, add 1, and return the resulting number.
#
# Let's call our function word_count()

### START YOUR CODE ###
def word_count(word):
    n = 1
    for x in word:
        if x == " ":
            n += 1
